### Contribution flow

A rough outline of an ideal contributors' workflow is as follows:

- Fork the current repository
- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. Mostly, it's the main branch.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure the commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push changes in a topic branch to your forked repository.
- Follow the checklist in the [pull request template](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-python/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- Before sending out the pull request, please sync your forked repository with the remote repository to ensure that your PR is elegant, concise. Reference the guide below:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:apache/dubbo-python.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git checkout -b your_awesome_patch
... add some work
git push origin your_awesome_patch

```

- Submit a pull request to apache/dubbo-python and wait for the reply.

Thanks for contributing!

### Code style

We use **ruff** as the linter and code formatter for Dubbo-Python, and **Mypy** as the static type checker.

Therefore, when developing, you should install both tools:

- ruff: [https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)
- Mypy: [https://github.com/python/mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)

We have already set up the configurations for ruff and Mypy in the `pyproject.toml` file. You only need to specify the configuration path (`pyproject.toml`) when using them.

1. Code Formatting
   
    By default, ruff will look for the `pyproject.toml` file in the current directory and its parent directories and load its configuration.
    
    ```bash
    # Default
    ruff format
    
    # Specify configuration file
    ruff format --config pyproject.toml
    ```
    
2. Code Linting
   
    ```bash
    # Just check
    ruff check
    
    # Check and fix
    ruff check --fix
    ```
    
3. Static Type Checking
   
    Mypy will also automatically look for the `pyproject.toml` file and load its configuration.
    
    ```bash
    # Default
    mypy
    
    # Specify configuration file
    mypy --config-file pyproject.toml
    ```
